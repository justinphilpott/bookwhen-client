### How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing! 

This library follows the standard Github Flow contribution workflow, have a read of the guide to [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow#following-github-flow) from the Github docs, if you're not familiar.

### Contribution Requirements

- Use the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) style when writing your commit messages.
- Ensure you create a [changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) as the final commit before creating a new PR (or updating one).

#### Setting Up Husky for Contributions

This project uses Husky for Git hooks and Commitlint to enforce commit message standards.

Install Dependencies: First, clone the repository and install the project dependencies, which include Husky:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
pnpm install
```

Activate Husky Hooks: After installing dependencies, you need to initialize Husky's Git hooks. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm husky install
```

This command sets up a .husky/ directory in the project, linking the necessary scripts to Gitâ€™s hook system. Once activated, Husky will automatically enforce commit message standards during commits.

Thank you for helping maintain commit quality and consistency!

- Contrib user creates a feature branch
- Contrib user generates commits to feature branch
- Contrib user create a PR back to the origin
- CI pipeline activates and runs at least tests && build
-> On success PR can be merged to main by Maintainer
-> On fail PR needs updating until success


### Maintainer flow

- Maintainer decides that code on main is ready to release
