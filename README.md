### Setting Up Husky for Contributions

This project uses Husky for Git hooks and Commitlint to enforce commit message standards.

Install Dependencies: First, clone the repository and install the project dependencies, which include Husky:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
pnpm install
```

Activate Husky Hooks: After installing dependencies, you need to initialize Husky's Git hooks. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm husky install
```

This command sets up a .husky/ directory in the project, linking the necessary scripts to Gitâ€™s hook system. Once activated, Husky will automatically enforce commit message standards during commits.

Thank you for helping maintain commit quality and consistency!

## Roadmap

- Keep up with any future changes or additions to the [Bookwhen API](https://api.bookwhen.com/v2).
