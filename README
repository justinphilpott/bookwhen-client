## Setting Up Husky for Contributions

This project uses Husky for Git hooks and Commitlint to enforce commit message standards.

    Install Dependencies: First, clone the repository and install the project dependencies, which include Husky:

    bash

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
pnpm install

Activate Husky Hooks: After installing dependencies, you need to initialize Husky's Git hooks. Run the following command:

bash

    pnpm husky install

This command sets up a .husky/ directory in the project, linking the necessary scripts to Gitâ€™s hook system. Once activated, Husky will automatically enforce commit message standards during commits.

Thank you for helping maintain commit quality and consistency!
